# Sparky Blog Publishing

## Overview

Sparky automatically publishes weekly, daily, and monthly reports to the raibid-labs/docs blog.

**Current Status**: ✅ Blog is LIVE at https://raibid-labs.github.io/docs/blog/

## Blog Structure in raibid-labs/docs

```

```

## Frontmatter Format

All blog posts use Quartz-compatible frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "This Week in raibid-labs - Week 46, 2025"
description: "Weekly development report for raibid-labs"
date: 2025-11-14
tags: [sparky, weekly-report, raibid-labs]
author: Sparky
---
```

## How It Works

1. **Generate Report**: Sparky collects data and generates markdown
2. **Publish Script**: `scripts/publish.nu` clones docs repo and adds report
3. **Quartz Renders**: GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys
4. **Live in Minutes**: Blog post appears at raibid-labs.github.io/docs/blog/

The blog infrastructure is already set up in raibid-labs/docs:
- `content/blog/index.md` - Blog landing page
- `content/blog/2025/` - Year-organized reports
- Linked from main navigation
- Appears in Explorer sidebar

## Publishing Workflow

### Current (Manual)
```bash
# 1. Generate weekly report
just demo-weekly

# 2. Publish to docs repo
just publish-weekly

# 3. Wait ~2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy
# 4. Visit https://raibid-labs.github.io/docs/blog/
```

### Future (Automated)
```bash
# Planned: GitHub Actions runs nightly
# - Generates reports automatically
# - Publishes to blog
# - No manual intervention needed
```

## Commands

- `just publish-daily` - Publish today's digest to blog
- `just publish-weekly` - Publish this week's report to blog
- `just publish-monthly` - Publish this month's review to blog
- `just publish-all` - Publish all unpublished reports

## Blog Index

The blog index (`content/blog/index.md`) automatically lists all posts with:
- Recent posts (last 10)
- Archive by month
- Tags for filtering

## Integration with Quartz

The blog integrates seamlessly with Quartz's features:
- Full-text search
- Graph view relationships
- Bidirectional links
- RSS feed generation
- Tag-based navigation

## Publishing Script

See `scripts/publish.nu` for the Nushell implementation.
